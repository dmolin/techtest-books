==========================================================================

This project is a demo project part of the **Attack of the Clones** series (AOTC), where I show how to replicate part of a few widely used (web/mobile)apps on the market using specific technologies (React and Redux in this case)

The project is setup with Webpack and a development server with Hotreload and feature a typical scenario, with a page allowing to search for data.

Still a work-in-progress.
The current codebase implement a super basic postcode lookup for restaurants, using the Just-Eat public API endpoints.
